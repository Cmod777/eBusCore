# === CRONWATCH - System Cron Monitor Script ===
# Monitors all cron jobs (from user/root crontabs and system cron directories)
# and checks whether they have executed as expected using syslog timestamps.
# If a job is missing or hasn't run within a threshold, it triggers a log entry and a Telegram notification.

# --- Notes for GitHub ---
# This script assumes:
# 1. The system uses traditional syslog (/var/log/syslog).
#    On Debian/Raspberry Pi OS, you may need to install it:
#       sudo apt install rsyslog
#
# 2. You should let the system run for **24â€“48 hours** before trusting the first output,
#    to allow daily/weekly/monthly cron jobs to run at least once.
#
# 3. Cron jobs managed by `anacron` may not appear in syslog or be tracked precisely.
#
# 4. This tool provides a good approximation but **can generate false positives**
#    for rarely executed jobs or conditional command wrappers (e.g. `test -x ... || { ... }`).

# NOTE: This script currently monitors only traditional cron jobs (from crontab, /etc/cron.d/, etc.).
# Optionally, you may extend it to include:
# - @reboot jobs: These are executed once at system startup and are not tied to a regular schedule.
# - systemd timers: Many modern systems (e.g. Debian Bookworm, Ubuntu) use systemd timers as a replacement for cron.
#   These timers are managed via `.timer` and `.service` files and can be listed with `systemctl list-timers`.
# Adding support for these would allow broader and more complete monitoring of scheduled tasks across the system.
