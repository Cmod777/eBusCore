#   Example configuration for prometheus.sh.
#   Contains all tunable parameters and paths for boiler estimation.
#
#   Copy this file as .env.prometheus and update the values accordingly.
# ===============================================================

# === BOILER CHARACTERISTICS ===

MAX_POWER=24000
# Nominal maximum power of the boiler (in watts)
# Example: 24000 for a 24 kW Vaillant ecoTEC

BOILER_EFFICIENCY=0.99
# Thermal efficiency (as decimal). E.g., 0.99 = 99%

GAS_LOWER_HEATING_VALUE=34.7
# PCI of methane in MJ/mÂ³. Adjust if using propane or LPG

WATT_TO_MJH=0.0036
# Fixed conversion: 1 watt = 0.0036 MJ/h


# === CONSUMPTION CORRECTION LOGIC ===

CORRECTION_PERCENTAGE=10
# Correction factor applied to calculated gas (e.g., 10 = +10%)
# This is auto-updated by the gas_correction.sh script if enabled.


# === TELEGRAM NOTIFICATIONS ===

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
# Obtain from @BotFather

TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
# Numeric ID of the recipient (check using @userinfobot)


# === LOGGING PATHS (absolute paths recommended) ===

DEBUG_LOG="/var/log/prometheus/debug_prometheus.log"
# Full runtime log: modulation, flame, signals, etc.

SUCCESS_LOG_FILE="/var/log/prometheus/prometheus_success.log"
# Stores valid heating cycles with gas and timestamps

ERROR_LOG_FILE="/var/log/prometheus/prometheus_errors.log"
# Logs SSH/command failures and retries

# Ensure the above paths exist and are writable by the script user
