  <summary>SaveMeImage.sh <code>2025-05-06</code> <code>upgrade</code> <code>active</code></summary>


The original SaveMe.sh was a purely technical backup script.
It has now been fixed and upgraded to SaveMeImage.sh, which generates
a fully bootable SD-card imageâ€”making backups faster, more user-friendly,
and ready to deploy with a single write.
