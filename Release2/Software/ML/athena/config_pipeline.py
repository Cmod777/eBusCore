# SAFETY NOTE
# ========================
# Only change these constants if:
# - You fully understand the impact on resource usage and performance.
# - The change has been tested in a safe development environment.
# - You ensure compatibility with logic in the training, validation, and monitoring subsystems.
# Any misconfiguration here can cause unstable behavior or model failure.
