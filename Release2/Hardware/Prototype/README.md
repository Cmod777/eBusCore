# Prototypes Archive

This folder contains early-stage hardware prototypes developed during the design and testing phases of the ATLAS PU project and related systems.

## Structure

- `images/`: Photos of physical builds, assembly phases, and real-world wiring
- `schematics/`: Circuit diagrams, logic maps, and hand-drawn draft plans
- `README.md`: General description and progress summary

## Purpose

This archive is meant to:
- Document partial builds and design iterations
- Preserve failed or deprecated prototypes for future reference
- Avoid repeating the same mistakes
- Support later recovery, debugging, or redesign phases

## Disclaimer

Some of these prototypes were damaged or failed due to poor soldering, incorrect voltage handling, or unrealistic expectations for component tolerances.

Despite that, **each test helped refine the overall system** and contributed to identifying real-world constraints.

> Not every prototype needs to succeed. Some are just meant to teach.
