# Changelog – From Versions 1–3

This document outlines the known limitations of versions 1.0 to 3.0 and the general areas of improvement introduced in the new design phase (post-prototype).

## Limitations in Versions 1–3

The following critical issues were identified during internal tests:

- Lack of **active protections** (e.g. automatic shutdown, current limiting)  
- Lack of **passive protections** (e.g. fuses, diodes, PTCs)  
- Insufficient **electrical safety measures**  
- Incomplete or absent **filtering for EMI and power stability**  
- Weak **physical structure and internal layout**  
- Missing or partial **documentation and test procedures**

## Improvements in Current Design

A new version of the system is under development, featuring:

- Addition of **active and passive safety protections**  
- Better **power routing and component separation**  
- Improvements in **logic, structural layout, and thermal behavior**  
- Clear, modular **wiring and connection standards**  
- Enhanced **technical documentation** and risk awareness

**Note:** Versions 1 to 3 are now deprecated and archived. They must not be used for future developments or deployments.
