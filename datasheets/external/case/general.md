# External Datasheets â€“ Case

This directory is intended to store technical datasheets and related documentation for external enclosures, such as electrical distribution boxes, surface-mounted cases, and IP-rated housings used in this project.

## Purpose
To provide a centralized location for all manufacturer datasheets, technical drawings, and specifications related to external hardware components.

## Structure
- PDF files with official datasheets
- Optional wiring notes or mounting guides
- Files may be added over time as new components are integrated

## Notes
This is a placeholder file to initialize the folder structure on GitHub. All relevant documents for "case" components will be stored here.
