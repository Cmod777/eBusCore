# License Overview

**License Version:** 1.0.0 â€” *April 2025*


Due to the diverse nature of the materials contained in this repository (technical documentation, wiring diagrams, datasheets, images, educational content, and more), it is not possible to apply a single unified license to the entire project.

Instead, this repository uses a combination of different licensing models, each applied according to the type of content.

Below, each section clearly defines the applicable license, usage rights, and limitations.
Please read carefully to ensure compliance with the licensing terms associated with each part of the project.
