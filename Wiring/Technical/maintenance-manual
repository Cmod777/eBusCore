| Condition                     | Immediate Action                          | Notes                              |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Grid power loss               | UPS module activates automatically         | Confirm Red LED is ON               |
| eBUS not powered during outage| Check relay, battery voltage, 5V output    | Switch back to grid after recovery  |
| After power returns           | Relay opens, returns to grid-sourced 5V    | Ensure USB-C switching is clean     |

### 9.2 Battery Failure

| Symptom                        | Diagnosis Steps                        | Recovery Action                     |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| eBUS turns off in blackout     | Measure battery: <11.5V                | Replace SLA battery immediately     |
| Battery bloated or warm        | Visual + temperature inspection        | Disconnect and dispose properly     |
| Charging LED never turns off   | Possible float circuit fault           | Verify voltage stabilizer or charger|

### 9.3 Relay Stuck or Fails to Switch

| Symptom                        | Diagnosis Steps                        | Recovery Action                     |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Relay doesn’t click (AF or UPS)| Measure 12V coil                       | Check fuse or replace relay module  |
| Relay always closed (bypassed) | Remove control signal + check contact  | Replace or isolate module           |

### 9.4 Step-Down Failure (5V USB-C)

| Symptom                        | Diagnosis Steps                        | Recovery Action                     |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| No 5V output on USB-C          | Measure input, then output             | Replace module or check fuses       |
| USB-C only works on one source | Check diode orientation (1N5822)       | Replace failed diode or converter   |

### 9.5 Shelly Module Failure

| Module       | Common Failures                 | Suggested Response               |
|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Shelly “AF”  | No relay output / no connection | Power cycle or factory reset     |
| Shelly “TADO”| No 230V to thermostat            | Check app + verify wiring        |
| Both         | Unreachable on network          | Restart router / reflash firmware|

### 9.6 Temporary Bypass (for emergency heating)

If the eBUS Wi-Fi module is not operational and urgent heating is required:

1. **Disconnect EXIT 1 (Tado)** if stuck
2. **Manually short OT BUS+ and BUS−** from Tado to Boiler (if safe)
3. **Power Tado directly via external 230V socket**
4. **Monitor boiler from local interface only**

> This bypass is temporary and must be undone once system is repaired.

Always log all emergency actions, failures, and corrective measures in the Maintenance Record Template.
